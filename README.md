# INTEGRATING SHELL SCRIPTING WITH AWS TO PERFORM BASIC AUTOMATION TASKS

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

In this project, I have created a shell script that will perform the following operations

> Launches an ec2 instance suitable for training ml models i.e. having higher configurations

> Installing all the necessary packages and python libraries after the instance is launched with the help of a different script

> It will identify if the 2nd script have required permissions to run on a remote instance if not then it will provide the necessary permissions

> The user will get an option to either upload the required dataset and py files using GitHub repositories or by transferring the directories directly to the remote instance

> Also the user can train the model multiple times by changing certain parameters in python code (like the epochs values, neural network layers, etc) on the same instance within different workspaces

> After the model is trained the user will get an option to download the modelâ€™s .h5 file directly into their local VM
